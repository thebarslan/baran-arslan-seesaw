# ⚖️ Seesaw Physics Simulator

A simple yet interactive **Seesaw (Balance Board) Simulator** built with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
Users can add weights to both sides of the seesaw, observe balance behavior, switch between themes, and reset the simulation easily.

## 🧠 Overview

This project is a web-based simulation that visually demonstrates the concept of **balance and torque** using a digital seesaw.

## ✨ Features

- 🎨 **Multiple Themes:** Sky, Sun, Forest, and Night modes for visual variety  
- ⚙️ **Interactive Settings:** Toggle box shape (circle/rectangle), theme selection, and simulation options  
- 🧱 **Dynamic Boxes:** Add boxes of different weights on the seesaw  
- 🔄 **Smooth Animation:** Realistic tilting motion using CSS transitions  
- 🧾 **Activity Logs:** Displays recent weight placements and balance changes  
- 🧹 **Reset Button:** Instantly reset the scene to default state  
- 📱 **Responsive Design:** Optimized for mobile and desktop views

## 🕹️ How It Works

1. Click anywhere on the plank area to **add a weight**.  
2. Watch the seesaw tilt dynamically based on total weights on each side.  
3. View **real-time logs** showing where and how much weight was added.  
4. Use the settings menu to:
   - Change the **box type** (circle/rectangle)
   - Switch between **themes**
5. Press **Reset** to clear all weights and restart.

## 🧠 Physics Concept

The balance of the seesaw is determined by the **moment of force** principle:

\[
\text{Torque} = \text{Force} \times \text{Distance from Pivot}
\]

When torques on both sides are equal, the plank remains horizontal; otherwise, it tilts toward the heavier side.
